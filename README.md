<h3 align="center">Fake News Classification with Keras</h3>


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project looks at building, training and evaluating neural networks to solve the [fake news classification problem](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset) on Kaggle. It uses Python and Keras. 

Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) are used, along with batch normalization and both spaCy and Keras embedding layers. 

Keras embedded models appear to outperform those with a static spaCy embedding and manage to achieve extremely high test accuracies (99%+).

The run_models.ipynb notebook contains a demo of how code from the two Python files can be used to easily implement the networks needed to solve this task.
